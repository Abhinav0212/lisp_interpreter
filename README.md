We start with a lexical analyzer/scanner.

The input to the scanner is a sequence of ASCII characters consisting of upper-case letters: A, B, ..., Z, digits: 0, 1, ..., 9, parentheses: ( ) , and ASCII white spaces. The ASCII characters in the input are used to form five kinds of tokens: Atom, OpenParenthesis, ClosingParenthesis, ERROR, and EOF.
